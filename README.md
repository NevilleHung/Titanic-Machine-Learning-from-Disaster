# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster is one of the Kaggle competitions which aims at using machine learning to create a model for  predicting the type of passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. (website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview/description)

I have developed a Decision Tree Classification Model with the use of train.csv (i.e. training set) for predicting whether the passengers in the test.csv (i.e. testing set) survived the Titanic shipwreck.  The prediction accuracy is around 78%, proved by submission of my prediction result to 'Evaluation' (website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview/evaluation).
